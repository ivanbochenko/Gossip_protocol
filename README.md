# Gossip_protocol
Implementation of gossip protocol in python.
To start a program run:
  python main.py x y
Where x is the number of nodes and y is the number of protocol iterations.

The program outputs the succes rate e.g persentage of cases all nodes recieved the message.
To increase the succes persentage the number of nodes where message is sending may be increased.
